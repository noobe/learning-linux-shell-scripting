# learning-linux-shell-scripting
A project to familiarize with Linux shell scripting

A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.

01. Creating the 1st script
- Created a file '01.sh'
- Before adding anything else to the script, added the shebang construct `#!/bin/bash` to alert the system that a shell script is being started.
- Added 2 commands `pwd` and `ls` in the file.
- Opened the terminal and ran the command `chmod +x <file-name>` in order to make the script executable.
- Ran script using full path. In case the terminal is opened in the file location, then `./<file-name.ext>`
